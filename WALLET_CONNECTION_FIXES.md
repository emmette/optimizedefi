# Wallet Connection Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. WalletConnect Configuration
- **Problem**: WalletConnect was required but project ID was not configured
- **Solution**: Made WalletConnect optional - only initialized when valid project ID exists
- **File**: `frontend/lib/web3.ts`

### 2. API Endpoint Routing
- **Problem**: Frontend was trying to call auth endpoints on itself instead of backend
- **Solution**: Updated all auth API calls to use backend URL
- **Files**: 
  - `frontend/hooks/useSiwe.ts`
  - `frontend/store/authStore.ts`

### 3. SIWE Authentication Flow
- **Problem**: Authentication wasn't properly connected to backend
- **Solutions**:
  - Fixed nonce endpoint to use POST method with address
  - Extract and include address in login request body
  - Store access token on successful login
  - Add Authorization headers to authenticated requests

### 4. Error Handling
- **Added**: Connection error logging for debugging
- **Added**: User feedback when no wallets are available
- **Added**: Console logging for connection attempts

## Testing Instructions

1. **Ensure services are running**:
   ```bash
   # Backend (already running in Docker)
   docker-compose ps
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Connect wallet**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Connect Wallet" button
   - Select MetaMask (or other injected wallet)
   - Approve connection in wallet popup
   - Sign the SIWE message when prompted

3. **Verify connection**:
   - Wallet address should appear in header
   - Green dot indicates connection
   - Shield icon appears when authenticated

## Optional: Enable WalletConnect

1. Get a project ID from https://cloud.walletconnect.com
2. Update `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id
   ```
3. Restart frontend server

## Debugging

Check browser console (F12) for:
- Connection errors
- Authentication failures
- API call issues

Backend logs can be viewed with:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f backend
```
