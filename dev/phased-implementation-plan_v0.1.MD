## Git Commit Convention

Each completed task should have a descriptive commit message:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code restructuring
- `test:` for test additions
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: Implement MetaMask wallet connection with multi-chain support`

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Time Management**: Focus on MVP features first, advanced features only if time permits
2. **API Limits**: Implement caching and request batching early
3. **Deployment Issues**: Test Railway deployment early and often
4. **Complex Features**: Have simpler fallback implementations ready
5. **Demo Day**: Prepare offline demo capability in case of network issues
